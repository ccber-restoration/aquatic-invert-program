# Methods
-  2017: pilot program, data not usable due to sorting & identification issues 
-  2018: 12 sampling sites (4 in COPR and 8 in NCOS)
-  2019: expanded to include expanded to include:  
    -  Pier, NPB1, and NPB2.
    -   Vernal pools (8) : VOW1, NVP10, VWCB, VCC7, VDSW, VM3, VM7, and VMM
for that year
- Samples are collected once per academic quarter (4 times per year)

-  Shifted from filtered beaker method to dip net (3 ft sweep)
